Basically started working to make all the classes xmlserializable and viewable from a property grid.
I also removed all abilities to describe color for an object since color is not important for Newtonian physics.
Also made it so direct X is no longer the renderer for the windows driver. So you no longer need 
the DirectX SDK. 

The properties editor works, but is not yet integrated into the windows driver
to allow you to edit the objects in it.

Since a lot of prayer has gone into this engine:
Soli Deo Gloria! To God alone be the glory!
