# Physics2D.Net

_<https://github.com/timdetering/Physics2D.Net>_

The fork of Physics2D.Net from http://code.google.com/p/physics2d/

Physics2D.Net is 2 dimensional rigid body physics engine written in C#. To work with XNA, Silverlight and .Net.

It is a complete rewrite of my original physics 2D found on source forge. It is CLS compliant. Currently it has only one collision solver. The narrow phase collision detector is considered to be part of the solver. The Solver is Sequential impulses with a distance grid used for narrow phase detection. There are 4 Broad phase detectors to choose from.

Features:

* Uses the split impulses solver from Box2D.
* This 2D Physics Engine is written entirely in C# and is optimized for C#.
* It has a wide range of Shapes and supports concave and convex polygons.
* It has a large number of Methods to manipulate Polygons such as generating a polygon from a bitmap (sprite).
* The math library it uses (AdvanceMath) is written entirely in C# and is optimized for C#.
* It uses a class called PhysicsLogic to implement a wide Range of effects from gravity to Maximum velocities.
* Joints allow bodies to be tied together to make complex systems like ropes and rag dolls.
* A large amount of parameter checking is done to reduce buggy implementations.
* Has a simple and elegant design.
* It is Renderer independent, so it can be used with either Managed Direct X (MDX), XNA, OpenGl, WPF, SilverLight or another Renderer of your choice. (The Demo uses OpenGl)
* A very unrestrictive license (MIT) so you can use it for any kind of project.
* The code is well commented using C#â€™s XML comments.
